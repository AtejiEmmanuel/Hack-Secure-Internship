# Hack Secure Internship 

## Overview
This repository contains projects and tasks completed during my internship at Hack Secure from April 10th, 2025 to May 5th, 2025. The internship focused on practical cybersecurity skills including vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, traffic analysis, and tool development.

## About Me
- **Name**: Emmanuel Ateji
- **Education**: Sheffield Hallam University (Alumni)
- **Major**: Cyber Security

## Key Projects

### 1. Web Application Security Assessment
- Conducted vulnerability scanning on test websites
- Performed port scanning with Nmap
- Executed directory enumeration using Gobuster
- Analyzed SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Tested for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) weaknesses

### 2. Network Security Analysis
- Intercepted and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark
- Captured authentication credentials in simulated environments
- Performed Wi-Fi security testing including de-authentication attacks
- Implemented handshake capture and password cracking techniques

### 3. Python Security Tools
- **Password Strength Checker**: Evaluates password strength based on complexity criteria
- **Port Scanner**: Multithreaded tool for identifying open ports on target systems
- **File Encryption/Decryption Tool**: Secure file encryption using Fernet symmetric encryption

### 4. CTF Challenge Solutions
- Completed "Pickle Rick" CTF challenge
- Practiced red team fundamentals and methodologies
- Applied various enumeration techniques to discover flags
